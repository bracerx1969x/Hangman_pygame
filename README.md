## Welcome to my Hangman game project!

This project was initiated by my working through a three-part tutorial on Youtube that teaches how to use pygame.

Overview:
These videos below are written by TechWithTim:

##### Pycharm Youtube Tutorials
```markdown

1. Python Hangman Tutorial #1 - Learn to Make Games with Pygame (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d038LZp_Jhk)
2. Python Hangman Tutorial #2 - Pygame Mouse Events & Collision (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6cjx7t39d4)
3. Python Hangman Tutorial #3 - Main Menu, Rendering Text & Finishing Touches (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d038LZp_Jhk)

```
I've also completed another Hangman tutorial on the JetBrains Academy's hyperskill tutorial site. For this version, which I worked through before the Pygame tutorial version, is written using Object Oriented Programming styles as much as I could. I did this to practice my coding techniques and to make it easier to add to later.

Objectives:
My intention for this overall project is to merge the OOP styles, further refining it as necessary and incorporate the graphical elements using Pygame learned during those tutorials.
